Independent Project - Piano Performance Analysis (Deep Learning for MIR) | 2025 – Present

(1)
•  Recreated and analyzed PercePiano dataset (1,202 performances, 19 perceptual dimensions; 22 performers across Schubert/Beethoven); built audio preprocessing and correlation analysis pipeline.
•  Established reproducible project structure (data, experiments, models, results) and feature extraction aligned with research (tempo, spectral centroid, RMS, etc.).
• Planned multi-task CNN for all 19 dimensions; evaluation via F1 (macro), MAE, and per-dimension metrics.

(2)
•  Performed dataset exploration and correlation analysis on PercePiano (1,202 performances, 19 perceptual dimensions, 22 performers; rating range documented).
•  Implemented an audio preprocessing pipeline and organized a clean repository structure (data, experiments, models, results, notebooks) to support iterative experiments.
•  Currently implementing feature extraction to match research approaches; next: train a single‑dimension prediction baseline (Timing_Stable_Unstable), then compare CNN vs. traditional ML methods.
•  Planned future work includes multi‑task learning covering all 19 dimensions and extending the dataset scope to additional repertoire (Chopin/Liszt).

(3)
•  Building ML pipeline to predict 19 perceptual dimensions using PyTorch with reproducible experiment infrastructure.
•  Applied product thinking: user-centered goals, phased roadmap (MVP → multi-task learning → expanded scope).
